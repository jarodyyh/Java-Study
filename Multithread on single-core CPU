Yes you can do multithreading on a single processor system.
In multi-processor system , multiple threads execute , simultaneously on different cores. Eg- If there are two threads and two cores , then each thread would run on individual core.
In a single-processor system, multiple threads execute , one after the other or wait until one thread finishes or is preempted by the OS , depending on the thread priority and the OS policy.But the running threads , gives an illusion that they run simultaneous , relative to the required application response time of the User space application.

Time Comparison(Example):
if two threads take 10us each to execute, then on a 2 processor system , the net time take is 10us
if two threads take 10us each to execute, then on a 1 processor system , the net time take is 20us
