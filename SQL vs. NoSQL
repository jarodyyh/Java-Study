SQL: Relational Database
NoSQL(Not only SQL): Non-relational / Distributed Database


SQL: table based
NoSQL: document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores


SQL: predefined schema
NoSQL: dynamic schema for unstructured data


SQL: vertically scalable, scaled by increasing CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server
NoSQL: horizontally scalable, scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load

SQL:uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data
NoSQL: uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language), which varies from database to database


SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb


SQL: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage
NoSQL: NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.


SQL: SQL databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) 
NoSQL: NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )
