The reason multithreading is still used in spite of its challenges is that multithreading can have several benefits. 
Some of these benefits are:

1. Better resource utilization.
    In general, the CPU can be doing other things while waiting for IO. 
    It doesn't have to be disk IO. It can be network IO as well, or input from a user at the machine. 
    Network and disk IO is often a lot slower than CPU's and memory IO.

2. Simpler program design in some situations.

3. More responsive programs.
